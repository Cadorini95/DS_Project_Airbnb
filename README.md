# DS_Project_Airbnb
 
This repository contains the analysis of a set of Airbnb open data used to predict the price of a listing. The project aims to developt an algorithm which helps people to estimate the price of a booking based on the apartment/house features. 

There are two files available in this repository: one files has the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), dataset treatments, feature and model selection. The other one contains the code related to the model deploy using streamlit to configurate buttons and features selected. To use the model, itÂ´s important to have the treated dataset and the code file in the same desktop file. 

The main goal is to keep improving the overall results, feature engineering and model selection in the next deploy versions.
